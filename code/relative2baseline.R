#Argument data, defines the dataset you want to convert to percentage baseline change.
#example implementation: relative2baseline('metoffice_england.csv')
#where 'metoffice_england.csv' is the output of the match.metoffice function (met office data matched to Google and with columns renamed in line with OpenWeather forecast format)

  #Find the non-baseline values  -----------------------------------------

  #make a vector of weekdays

  #This loop calculates the 'baseline change in weather' using Google's method applied to the Met Office data. Process:
  #1. Go through each weekday (first would be Monday)
  #2. Go through each Google district (first would be Bath and Northeast Somerset)
  #3. Go through each of the meteorological variables in columns 4:53 in the Met Office dataframe (first would be air temp mean max K)
  #4. Nonbaseline - A temporary object - in first instance, would be all the Met Office air temp mean max K measurements from all the Mondays from Bath and Northeast Somerset in the non-baseline time series
  #5. Baseline - A temporary object - in first instance, would be all the Met Office air temp mean max K measurements from all the Mondays from Bath and Northeast Somerset in the baseline time series
  #6. Diff_from_baseline - A temporary obect - Subtract baseline from nonbaseline to get absolute change in that variable per weekday per district (as in Google methods)
  #7. Write to the relative change dataframe in the appropriate columns - Make the difference relative by dividing it by the baseline and multiplying by 100 to get in percent as for Google data
